+The Way
+
+The Way that can be experienced is not true;
+The world that can be constructed is not real.
+The Way manifests all that happens and may happen;
+The world represents all that exists and may exist.
+To experience without abstraction is to sense the world;
+To experience with abstraction is to know the world.
+These two experiences are indistinguishable;
+Their construction differs but their effect is the same.
+Beyond the gate of experience flows the Way,
+Which is ever greater and more subtle than the world.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Abstraction
+
+When beauty is abstracted
+Then ugliness has been implied;
+When good is abstracted
+Then evil has been implied.
+So alive and dead are abstracted from nature,
+Difficult and easy abstracted from progress,
+Long and short abstracted from contrast,
+High and low abstracted from depth,
+Song and speech abstracted from melody,
+After and before abstracted from sequence.
+The sage experiences without abstraction,
+And accomplishes without action;
+He accepts the ebb and flow of things,
+Nurtures them, but does not own them,
+And lives, but does not dwell.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Without Action
+
+Not praising the worthy prevents contention,
+Not esteeming the valuable prevents theft,
+Not displaying the beautiful prevents desire.
+In this manner the sage governs people:
+Emptying their minds,
+Filling their bellies,
+Weakening their ambitions,
+And strengthening their bones.
+If people lack knowledge and desire
+Then they can not act;
+If no action is taken
+Harmony remains.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Limitless
+
+The Way is a limitless vessel;
+Used by the self, it is not filled by the world;
+It cannot be cut, knotted, dimmed or stilled;
+Its depths are hidden, ubiquitous and eternal;
+I don't know where it comes from;
+It comes before nature.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Nature
+
+Nature is not kind;
+It treats all things impartially.
+The Sage is not kind,
+And treats all people impartially.
+Nature is like a bellows,
+Empty, yet never ceasing its supply.
+The more it moves, the more it yields;
+So the sage draws upon experience
+And cannot be exhausted.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Experience
+
+Experience is a riverbed,
+Its source hidden, forever flowing:
+Its entrance, the root of the world,
+The Way moves within it:
+Draw upon it; it will not run dry.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Complete
+
+Nature is complete because it does not serve itself.
+The sage places himself after and finds himself before,
+Ignores his desire and finds himself content.
+He is complete because he does not serve himself.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Water
+
+The best of man is like water,
+Which benefits all things, and does not contend with them,
+Which flows in places that others disdain,
+Where it is in harmony with the Way.
+So the sage:
+Lives within nature,
+Thinks within the deep,
+Gives within impartiality,
+Speaks within trust,
+Governs within order,
+Crafts within ability,
+Acts within opportunity.
+He does not contend, and none contend against him.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Retire
+
+Fill a cup to its brim and it is easily spilled;
+Temper a sword to its hardest and it is easily broken;
+Amass the greatest treasure and it is easily stolen;
+Claim credit and honour and you easily fall;
+Retire once your purpose is achieved - this is natural.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Harmony
+
+Embracing the Way, you become embraced;
+Breathing gently, you become newborn;
+Clearing your mind, you become clear;
+Nurturing your children, you become impartial;
+Opening your heart, you become accepted;
+Accepting the world, you embrace the Way.
+Bearing and nurturing,
+Creating but not owning,
+Giving without demanding,
+This is harmony.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Tools
+
+Thirty spokes meet at a nave;
+Because of the hole we may use the wheel.
+Clay is moulded into a vessel;
+Because of the hollow we may use the cup.
+Walls are built around a hearth;
+Because of the doors we may use the house.
+Thus tools come from what exists,
+But use from what does not.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Substance
+
+Too much colour blinds the eye,
+Too much music deafens the ear,
+Too much taste dulls the palate,
+Too much play maddens the mind,
+Too much desire tears the heart.
+In this manner the sage cares for people:
+He provides for the belly, not for the senses;
+He ignores abstraction and holds fast to substance.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Self
+
+Both praise and blame cause concern,
+For they bring people hope and fear.
+The object of hope and fear is the self -
+For, without self, to whom may fortune and disaster occur?
+Therefore,
+Who distinguishes himself from the world may be given the world,
+But who regards himself as the world may accept the world.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Mystery
+
+Looked at but cannot be seen - it is beneath form;
+Listened to but cannot be heard - it is beneath sound;
+Held but cannot be touched - it is beneath feeling;
+These depthless things evade definition,
+And blend into a single mystery.
+In its rising there is no light,
+In its falling there is no darkness,
+A continuous thread beyond description,
+Lining what does not exist;
+Its form formless,
+Its image nothing,
+Its name silence;
+Follow it, it has no back,
+Meet it, it has no face.
+Attend the present to deal with the past;
+Thus you grasp the continuity of the Way,
+Which is its essence.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Enlightenment
+
+The enlightened possess understanding
+So profound they can not be understood.
+Because they cannot be understood
+I can only describe their appearance:
+Cautious as one crossing thin ice,
+Undecided as one surrounded by danger,
+Modest as one who is a guest,
+Unbounded as melting ice,
+Genuine as unshaped wood,
+Broad as a valley,
+Seamless as muddy water.
+Who stills the water that the mud may settle,
+Who seeks to stop that he may travel on,
+Who desires less than what may transpire,
+Decays, but will not renew.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Decay and Renewal
+
+Empty the self completely;
+Embrace perfect peace.
+The world will rise and move;
+Watch it return to rest.
+All the flourishing things
+Will return to their source.
+This return is peaceful;
+It is the flow of nature,
+An eternal decay and renewal.
+Accepting this brings enlightenment,
+Ignoring this brings misery.
+Who accepts nature's flow becomes all-cherishing;
+Being all-cherishing he becomes impartial;
+Being impartial he becomes magnanimous;
+Being magnanimous he becomes natural;
+Being natural he becomes one with the Way;
+Being one with the Way he becomes immortal:
+Though his body will decay, the Way will not.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Rulers
+
+The best rulers are scarcely known by their subjects;
+The next best are loved and praised;
+The next are feared;
+The next despised:
+They have no faith in their people,
+And their people become unfaithful to them.
+When the best rulers achieve their purpose
+Their subjects claim the achievement as their own.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Hypocrisy
+
+When the Way is forgotten
+Duty and justice appear;
+Then knowledge and wisdom are born
+Along with hypocrisy.
+When harmonious relationships dissolve
+Then respect and devotion arise;
+When a nation falls to chaos
+Then loyalty and patriotism are born.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Simplify
+
+If we could discard knowledge and wisdom
+Then people would profit a hundredfold;
+If we could discard duty and justice
+Then harmonious relationships would form;
+If we could discard artifice and profit
+Then waste and theft would disappear.
+Yet such remedies treat only symptoms
+And so they are inadequate.
+People need personal remedies:
+Reveal your naked self and embrace your original nature;
+Bind your self-interest and control your ambition;
+Forget your habits and simplify your affairs.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Wandering
+
+What is the difference between assent and denial?
+What is the difference between beautiful and ugly?
+What is the difference between fearsome and afraid?
+The people are merry as if at a magnificent party
+Or playing in the park at springtime,
+But I am tranquil and wandering,
+Like a newborn before it learns to smile,
+Alone, with no true home.
+The people have enough and to spare,
+Where I have nothing,
+And my heart is foolish,
+Muddled and cloudy.
+The people are bright and certain,
+Where I am dim and confused;
+The people are clever and wise,
+Where I am dull and ignorant;
+Aimless as a wave drifting over the sea,
+Attached to nothing.
+The people are busy with purpose,
+Where I am impractical and rough;
+I do not share the peoples' cares
+But I am fed at nature's breast.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Accept
+
+Harmony is only in following the Way.
+The Way is without form or quality,
+But expresses all forms and qualities;
+The Way is hidden and implicate,
+But expresses all of nature;
+The Way is unchanging,
+But expresses all motion.
+Beneath sensation and memory
+The Way is the source of all the world.
+How can I understand the source of the world?
+By accepting.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Home
+
+Accept and you become whole,
+Bend and you straighten,
+Empty and you fill,
+Decay and you renew,
+Want and you acquire,
+Fulfill and you become confused.
+The sage accepts the world
+As the world accepts the Way;
+He does not display himself, so is clearly seen,
+Does not justify himself, so is recognized,
+Does not boast, so is credited,
+Does not pride himself, so endures,
+Does not contend, so none contend against him.
+The ancients said, "Accept and you become whole",
+Once whole, the world is as your home.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Words
+
+Nature says only a few words:
+High wind does not last long,
+Nor does heavy rain.
+If nature's words do not last
+Why should those of man?
+Who accepts harmony, becomes harmonious.
+Who accepts loss, becomes lost.
+For who accepts harmony, the Way harmonizes with him,
+And who accepts loss, the Way cannot find.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Indulgence
+
+Straighten yourself and you will not stand steady;
+Display yourself and you will not be clearly seen;
+Justify yourself and you will not be respected;
+Promote yourself and you will not be believed;
+Pride yourself and you will not endure.
+These behaviours are wasteful, indulgent,
+And so they attract disfavour;
+Harmony avoids them.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Beneath Abstraction
+
+There is a mystery,
+Beneath abstraction,
+Silent, depthless,
+Alone, unchanging,
+Ubiquitous and liquid,
+The mother of nature.
+It has no name, but I call it "the Way";
+It has no limit, but I call it "limitless".
+Being limitless, it flows away forever;
+Flowing away forever, it returns to my self:
+The Way is limitless,
+So nature is limitless,
+So the world is limitless,
+And so I am limitless.
+For I am abstracted from the world,
+The world from nature,
+Nature from the Way,
+And the Way from what is beneath abstraction.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Calm
+
+Gravity is the source of lightness,
+Calm, the master of haste.
+A lone traveller will journey all day, watching over his
+belongings;
+Only safe in his own bed may he lose them in sleep.
+So the captain of a great vessel should not act lightly or hastily.
+Acting lightly, he loses sight of the world,
+Acting hastily, he loses control of himself.
+The captain can not treat his great ship as a small boat;
+Rather than glitter like jade
+He must stand like stone.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Perfection
+
+The perfect traveller leaves no trail to be followed;
+The perfect speaker leaves no question to be answered;
+The perfect accountant leaves no working to be completed;
+The perfect container leaves no lock to be closed;
+The perfect knot leaves no end to be ravelled.
+So the sage nurtures all men
+And abandons no one.
+He accepts everything
+And rejects nothing.
+He attends to the smallest details.
+For the strong must guide the weak;
+The weak are raw material to the strong.
+If the guide is not respected,
+Or the material is not cared for,
+Confusion will result, no matter how clever one is.
+This is the secret of perfection:
+When raw wood is carved, it becomes a tool;
+When a man is employed, he becomes a tool;
+The perfect carpenter leaves no wood to be carved.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Becoming
+
+Using the male, being female,
+Being the entrance of the world,
+You embrace harmony
+And become as a newborn.
+Using strength, being weak,
+Being the root of the world,
+You complete harmony
+And become as unshaped wood.
+Using the light, being dark,
+Being the world,
+You perfect harmony
+And return to the Way.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Ambition
+
+Those who wish to change the world
+According with their desire
+Cannot succeed.
+The world is shaped by the Way;
+It cannot be shaped by the self.
+Trying to change it, you damage it;
+Trying to possess it, you lose it.
+So some will lead, while others follow.
+Some will be warm, others cold
+Some will be strong, others weak.
+Some will get where they are going
+While others fall by the side of the road.
+So the sage will be neither extravagant nor violent.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Violence
+
+Powerful men are well advised not to use violence,
+For violence has a habit of returning;
+Thorns and weeds grow wherever an army goes,
+And lean years follow a great war.
+A general is well advised
+To achieve nothing more than his orders:
+Not to take advantage of his victory.
+Nor to glory, boast or pride himself;
+To do what is dictated by necessity,
+Not by choice.
+For even the strongest force will weaken with time,
+And then its violence will return, and kill it.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Armies
+
+Armies are tools of violence;
+They cause men to hate and fear.
+The sage will not join them.
+His purpose is creation;
+Their purpose is destruction.
+Weapons are tools of violence,
+Not of the sage;
+He uses them only when there is no choice,
+And then calmly, and with tact,
+For he finds no beauty in them.
+Whoever finds beauty in weapons
+Delights in the slaughter of men;
+And who delights in slaughter
+Cannot content himself with peace.
+So slaughters must be mourned
+And conquest celebrated with a funeral.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Shapes
+
+The Way has no true shape,
+And therefore none can control it.
+If a ruler could control the Way
+All things would follow
+In harmony with his desire,
+And sweet rain would fall,
+Effortlessly slaking every thirst.
+The Way is shaped by use,
+But then the shape is lost.
+Do not hold fast to shapes
+But let sensation flow into the world
+As a river courses down to the sea.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Virtues
+
+Who understands the world is learned;
+Who understands the self is enlightened.
+Who conquers the world has strength;
+Who conquers the self has harmony;
+Who is determined has purpose.
+Who is contented has wealth;
+Who defends his home may long endure;
+Who surrenders his home may long survive it.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Control
+
+The Way flows and ebbs, creating and destroying,
+Implementing all the world, attending to the tiniest details,
+Claiming nothing in return.
+It nurtures all things,
+Though it does not control them;
+It has no intention,
+So it seems inconsequential.
+It is the substance of all things;
+Though it does not control them;
+It has no exception,
+So it seems all-important.
+The sage would not control the world;
+He is in harmony with the world.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Peace
+
+If you offer music and food
+Strangers may stop with you;
+But if you accord with the Way
+All the people of the world will keep you
+In safety, health, community, and peace.
+The Way lacks art and flavour;
+It can neither be seen nor heard,
+But its benefit cannot be exhausted.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Opposition
+
+To reduce someone's influence, first expand it;
+To reduce someone's force, first increase it;
+To overthrow someone, first exalt them;
+To take from someone, first give to them.
+This is the subtlety by which the weak overcome the strong:
+Fish should not leave their depths,
+And swords should not leave their scabbards.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Tranquillity
+
+The Way takes no action, but leaves nothing undone.
+When you accept this
+The world will flourish,
+In harmony with nature.
+Nature does not possess desire;
+Without desire, the heart becomes quiet;
+In this manner the whole world is made tranquil.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Ritual
+
+Well established hierarchies are not easily uprooted;
+Closely held beliefs are not easily released;
+So ritual enthralls generation after generation.
+Harmony does not care for harmony, and so is naturally attained;
+But ritual is intent upon harmony, and so can not attain it.
+Harmony neither acts nor reasons;
+Love acts, but without reason;
+Justice acts to serve reason;
+But ritual acts to enforce reason.
+When the Way is lost, there remains harmony;
+When harmony is lost, there remains love;
+When love is lost, there remains justice;
+And when justice is lost, there remains ritual.
+Ritual is the end of compassion and honesty,
+The beginning of confusion;
+Belief is a colourful hope or fear,
+The beginning of folly.
+The sage goes by harmony, not by hope;
+He dwells in the fruit, not the flower;
+He accepts substance, and ignores abstraction.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Support
+
+In mythical times all things were whole:
+All the sky was clear,
+All the earth was stable,
+All the mountains were firm,
+All the riverbeds were full,
+All of nature was fertile,
+And all the rulers were supported.
+But, losing clarity, the sky tore;
+Losing stability, the earth split;
+Losing strength, the mountains sank;
+Losing water, the riverbeds cracked;
+Losing fertility, nature disappeared;
+And losing support, the rulers fell.
+Rulers depend upon their subjects,
+The noble depend upon the humble;
+So rulers call themselves orphaned, hungry and alone,
+To win the people's support.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Motion and Use
+
+The motion of the Way is to return;
+The use of the Way is to accept;
+All things come from the Way,
+And the Way comes from nothing.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Following
+
+When the great man learns the Way, he follows it with diligence;
+When the common man learns the Way, he follows it on occasion;
+When the mean man learns the Way, he laughs out loud;
+Those who do not laugh, do not learn at all.
+Therefore it is said:
+Who understands the Way seems foolish;
+Who progresses on the Way seems to fail;
+Who follows the Way seems to wander.
+For the finest harmony appears plain;
+The brightest truth appears coloured;
+The richest character appears incomplete;
+The bravest heart appears meek;
+The simplest nature appears inconstant.
+The square, perfected, has no corner;
+Music, perfected, has no melody;
+Love, perfected, has no climax;
+Art, perfected, has no meaning.
+The Way can be neither sensed nor known:
+It transmits sensation and transcends knowledge.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Mind
+
+The Way bears sensation,
+Sensation bears memory,
+Sensation and memory bear abstraction,
+And abstraction bears all the world;
+Each thing in the world bears feeling and doing,
+And, imbued with mind, harmony with the Way.
+As others have taught, so do I teach,
+"Who loses harmony opposes nature";
+This is the root of my teaching.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Overcoming
+
+Water overcomes the stone;
+Without substance it requires no opening;
+This is the benefit of taking no action.
+Yet benefit without action,
+And experience without abstraction,
+Are practiced by very few.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Contentment
+
+Health or reputation: which is held dearer?
+Health or possessions: which has more worth?
+Profit or loss: which is more troublesome?
+Great love incurs great expense,
+And great wealth incurs great fear,
+But contentment comes at no cost.
+For who knows when to stop
+Does not continue into danger,
+And so may long endure.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Quiet
+
+Great perfection seems incomplete,
+But does not decay;
+Great abundance seems empty,
+But does not fail.
+Great truth seems contradictory;
+Great cleverness seems stupid;
+Great eloquence seems awkward.
+As spring overcomes the cold,
+And autumn overcomes the heat,
+So calm and quiet overcome the world.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Horses
+
+When a nation follows the Way,
+Horses bear manure through its fields;
+When a nation ignores the Way,
+Horses bear soldiers through its streets.
+There is no greater mistake than following desire;
+There is no greater disaster than forgetting contentment;
+There is no greater sickness than seeking attainment;
+But one who is content to satisfy his needs
+Finds that contentment endures.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Knowing
+
+Without taking a step outdoors
+You know the whole world;
+Without taking a peep out the window
+You know the colour of the sky.
+The more you experience,
+The less you know.
+The sage wanders without knowing,
+Looks without seeing,
+Accomplishes without acting.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Inaction
+
+The follower of knowledge learns as much as he can every day;
+The follower of the Way forgets as much as he can every day.
+By attrition he reaches a state of inaction
+Wherein he does nothing, but nothing remains undone.
+To conquer the world, accomplish nothing;
+If you must accomplish something,
+The world remains beyond conquest.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+People
+
+The sage does not distinguish between himself and the world;
+The needs of other people are as his own.
+He is good to those who are good;
+He is also good to those who are not good,
+Thereby he is good.
+He trusts those who are trustworthy;
+He also trusts those who are not trustworthy,
+Thereby he is trustworthy.
+The sage lives in harmony with the world,
+And his mind is the world's mind.
+So he nurtures the worlds of others
+As a mother does her children.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Death
+
+Men flow into life, and ebb into death.
+Some are filled with life;
+Some are empty with death;
+Some hold fast to life, and thereby perish,
+For life is an abstraction.
+Those who are filled with life
+Need not fear tigers and rhinos in the wilds,
+Nor wear armour and shields in battle;
+The rhinoceros finds no place in them for its horn,
+The tiger no place for its claw,
+The soldier no place for a weapon,
+For death finds no place in them.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Nurture
+
+The Way bears all things;
+Harmony nurtures them;
+Nature shapes them;
+Use completes them.
+Each follows the Way and honours harmony,
+Not by law,
+But by being.
+The Way bears, nurtures, shapes, completes,
+Shelters, comforts, and makes a home for them.
+Bearing without possessing,
+Nurturing without taming,
+Shaping without forcing,
+This is harmony.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Clarity
+
+The origin of the world is its mother;
+Understand the mother, and you understand the child;
+Embrace the child, and you embrace the mother,
+Who will not perish when you die.
+Reserve your judgments and words
+And you maintain your influence;
+Speak your mind and take positions
+And nothing will save you.
+As observing detail is clarity,
+So maintaining flexibility is strength;
+Use the light but shed no light,
+So that you do yourself no harm,
+But embrace clarity.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Difficult Paths
+
+With but a small understanding
+One may follow the Way like a main road,
+Fearing only to leave it;
+Following a main road is easy,
+Yet people delight in difficult paths.
+When palaces are kept up
+Fields are left to weeds
+And granaries empty;
+Wearing fine clothes,
+Bearing sharp swords,
+Glutting with food and drink,
+Hoarding wealth and possessions -
+These are the ways of theft,
+And far from the Way.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Cultivate Harmony
+
+Cultivate harmony within yourself, and harmony becomes real;
+Cultivate harmony within your family, and harmony becomes fertile;
+Cultivate harmony within your community, and harmony becomes
+abundant;
+Cultivate harmony within your culture, and harmony becomes
+enduring;
+Cultivate harmony within the world, and harmony becomes ubiquitous.
+Live with a person to understand that person;
+Live with a family to understand that family;
+Live with a community to understand that community;
+Live with a culture to understand that culture;
+Live with the world to understand the world.
+How can I live with the world?
+By accepting.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Soft Bones
+
+Who is filled with harmony is like a newborn.
+Wasps and snakes will not bite him;
+Hawks and tigers will not claw him.
+His bones are soft yet his grasp is sure,
+For his flesh is supple;
+His mind is innocent yet his body is virile,
+For his vigour is plentiful;
+His song is long-lasting yet his voice is sweet,
+For his grace is perfect.
+But knowing harmony creates abstraction,
+And following abstraction creates ritual.
+Exceeding nature creates calamity,
+And controlling nature creates violence.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Impartiality
+
+Who understands does not preach;
+Who preaches does not understand.
+Reserve your judgments and words;
+Smooth differences and forgive disagreements;
+Dull your wit and simplify your purpose;
+Accept the world.
+Then,
+Friendship and enmity,
+Profit and loss,
+Honour and disgrace,
+Will not affect you;
+The world will accept you.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Conquer with Inaction
+
+Do not control the people with laws,
+Nor violence nor espionage,
+But conquer them with inaction.
+For:
+The more morals and taboos there are,
+The more cruelty afflicts people;
+The more guns and knives there are,
+The more factions divide people;
+The more arts and skills there are,
+The more change obsoletes people;
+The more laws and taxes there are,
+The more theft corrupts people.
+Yet take no action, and the people nurture eachother;
+Make no laws, and the people deal fairly with eachother;
+Own no interest, and the people cooperate with eachother;
+Express no desire, and the people harmonize with eachother.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+No End
+
+When government is lazy and informal
+The people are kind and honest;
+When government is efficient and severe
+The people are discontented and deceitful.
+Good fortune follows upon disaster;
+Disaster lurks within good fortune;
+Who can say how things will end?
+Perhaps there is no end.
+Honesty is ever deceived;
+Kindness is ever seduced;
+Men have been like this for a long time.
+So the sage is firm but not cutting,
+Pointed but not piercing,
+Straight but not rigid,
+Bright but not blinding.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Restraint
+
+Manage a great nation as you would cook a delicate fish.
+To govern men in accord with nature
+It is best to be restrained;
+Restraint makes agreement easy to attain,
+And easy agreement builds harmonious relationships;
+With sufficient harmony no resistance will arise;
+When no resistance arises, then you possess the heart of the
+nation,
+And when you possess the nation's heart, your influence will long
+endure:
+Deeply rooted and firmly established.
+This is the method of far sight and long life.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Demons
+
+When you use the Way to conquer the world,
+Your demons will lose their power to harm.
+It is not that they lose their power as such,
+But that they will not harm others;
+Because they will not harm others,
+You will not harm others:
+When neither you nor your demons can do harm,
+You will be at peace with them.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Submission
+
+A nation is like a hierarchy, a marketplace, and a maiden.
+A maiden wins her husband by submitting to his advances;
+Submission is a means of union.
+So when a large country submits to a small country
+It will adopt the small country;
+When a small country submits to a large country
+It will be adopted by the large country;
+The one submits and adopts;
+The other submits and is adopted.
+It is in the interest of a large country to unite and gain service,
+And in the interest of a small country to unite and gain patronage;
+If both would serve their interests,
+Both must submit.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Sin
+
+The Way is the fate of men,
+The treasure of the saint,
+And the refuge of the sinner.
+Fine words are often borrowed,
+And great deeds are often appropriated;
+Therefore, when a man falls, do not abandon him,
+And when a man gains power, do not honour him;
+Only remain impartial and show him the Way.
+Why should someone appreciate the Way?
+The ancients said, "By it, those who seek may easily find,
+And those who regret may easily absolve"
+So it is the most precious gift.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Difficulty
+
+Practice no-action;
+Attend to do-nothing;
+Taste the flavorless,
+Magnify the small,
+Multiply the few,
+Return love for hate.
+Deal with the difficult while it is yet easy;
+Deal with the great while it is yet small;
+The difficult develops naturally from the easy,
+And the great from the small;
+So the sage, by dealing with the small,
+Achieves the great.
+Who finds it easy to promise finds it hard to be trusted;
+Who takes things lightly finds things difficult;
+The sage recognizes difficulty, and so has none.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Care at the Beginning
+
+What lies still is easy to grasp;
+What lies far off is easy to anticipate;
+What is brittle is easy to shatter;
+What is small is easy to disperse.
+Yet a tree broader than a man can embrace is born of a tiny shoot;
+A dam greater than a river can overflow starts with a clod of
+earth;
+A journey of a thousand miles begins at the spot under one's feet.
+Therefore deal with things before they happen;
+Create order before there is confusion.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Care at the End
+
+He who acts, spoils;
+He who grasps, loses.
+People often fail on the verge of success;
+Take care at the end as at the beginning,
+So that you may avoid failure.
+The sage desires no-desire,
+Values no-value,
+Learns no-learning,
+And returns to the places that people have forgotten;
+He would help all people to become natural,
+But then he would not be natural.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Subtlety
+
+The ancients did not seek to rule people with knowledge,
+But to help them become natural.
+It is difficult for knowledgeable people to become natural.
+To use law to control a nation weakens the nation.
+But to use nature to control a nation strengthens the nation.
+Understanding these two paths is understanding subtlety;
+Subtlety runs deep, ranges wide,
+Resolves confusion and preserves peace.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Lead by Following
+
+The river carves out the valley by flowing beneath it.
+Thereby the river is the master of the valley.
+In order to master people
+One must speak as their servant;
+In order to lead people
+One must follow them.
+So when the sage rises above the people,
+They do not feel oppressed;
+And when the sage stands before the people,
+They do not feel hindered.
+So the popularity of the sage does not fail,
+He does not contend, and no one contends against him.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Unimportance
+
+All the world says,
+"I am important;
+I am separate from all the world.
+I am important because I am separate,
+Were I the same, I could never be important."
+Yet here are three treasures
+That I cherish and commend to you:
+The first is compassion,
+By which one finds courage.
+The second is restraint,
+By which one finds strength.
+And the third is unimportance,
+By which one finds influence.
+Those who are fearless, but without compassion,
+Powerful, but without restraint,
+Or influential, yet important,
+Cannot endure.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Compassion
+
+Compassion is the finest weapon and best defence.
+If you would establish harmony,
+Compassion must surround you like a fortress.
+Therefore,
+A good soldier does not inspire fear;
+A good fighter does not display aggression;
+A good conqueror does not engage in battle;
+A good leader does not exercise authority.
+This is the value of unimportance;
+This is how to win the cooperation of others;
+This to how to build the same harmony that is in nature.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Ambush
+
+There is a saying among soldiers:
+It is easier to lose a yard than take an inch.
+In this manner one may deploy troops without marshalling them,
+Bring weapons to bear without exposing them,
+Engage the foe without invading them,
+And exhaust their strength without fighting them.
+There is no worse disaster than misunderstanding your enemy;
+To do so endangers all of my treasures;
+So when two well matched forces oppose eachother,
+The general who maintains compassion will win.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Individuality
+
+My words are easy to understand
+And my actions are easy to perform
+Yet no other can understand or perform them.
+My words have meaning; my actions have reason;
+Yet these cannot be known and I cannot be known.
+We are each unique, and therefore valuable;
+Though the sage wears coarse clothes, his heart is jade.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Limitation
+
+Who recognizes his limitations is healthy;
+Who ignores his limitations is sick.
+The sage recognizes this sickness as a limitation.
+And so becomes immune.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Revolution
+
+When people have nothing more to lose,
+Then revolution will result.
+Do not take away their lands,
+And do not destroy their livelihoods;
+If your burden is not heavy then they will not shirk it.
+The sage maintains himself but exacts no tribute,
+Values himself but requires no honours;
+He ignores abstraction and accepts substance.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Fate
+
+Who is brave and bold will perish;
+Who is brave and subtle will benefit.
+The subtle profit where the bold perish
+For Fate does not honour daring.
+And even the sage dares not tempt fate.
+Fate does not attack, yet all things are conquered by it;
+It does not ask, yet all things answer to it;
+It does not call, yet all things meet it;
+It does not plan, yet all things are determined by it.
+Fate's net is vast and its mesh is coarse,
+Yet none escape it.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Execution
+
+If people were not afraid of death,
+Then what would be the use of an executioner?
+If people were only afraid of death,
+And you executed everyone who did not obey,
+No one would dare to disobey you.
+Then what would be the use of an executioner?
+People fear death because death is an instrument of fate.
+When people are killed by execution rather than by fate,
+This is like carving wood in the place of a carpenter.
+Those who carve wood in place of a carpenter
+Often injure their hands.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Rebellion
+
+When rulers take grain so that they may feast,
+Their people become hungry;
+When rulers take action to serve their own interests,
+Their people become rebellious;
+When rulers take lives so that their own lives are maintained,
+Their people no longer fear death.
+When people act without regard for their own lives
+They overcome those who value only their own lives.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Flexibility
+
+A newborn is soft and tender,
+A crone, hard and stiff.
+Plants and animals, in life, are supple and succulent;
+In death, withered and dry.
+So softness and tenderness are attributes of life,
+And hardness and stiffness, attributes of death.
+Just as a sapless tree will split and decay
+So an inflexible force will meet defeat;
+The hard and mighty lie beneath the ground
+While the tender and weak dance on the breeze above.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Need
+
+Is the action of nature not unlike drawing a bow?
+What is higher is pulled down, and what is lower is raised up;
+What is taller is shortened, and what is thinner is broadened;
+Nature's motion decreases those who have more than they need
+And increases those who need more than they have.
+It is not so with Man.
+Man decreases those who need more than they have
+And increases those who have more than they need.
+To give away what you do not need is to follow the Way.
+So the sage gives without expectation,
+Accomplishes without claiming credit,
+And has no desire for ostentation.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Yielding
+
+Nothing in the world is as soft and yielding as water,
+Yet nothing can better overcome the hard and strong,
+For they can neither control nor do away with it.
+The soft overcomes the hard,
+The yielding overcomes the strong;
+Every person knows this,
+But no one can practice it.
+Who attends to the people would control the land and grain;
+Who attends to the state would control the whole world;
+Truth is easily hidden by rhetoric.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Reconciliation
+
+When conflict is reconciled, some hard feelings remain;
+This is dangerous.
+The sage accepts less than is due
+And does not blame or punish;
+For harmony seeks agreement
+Where justice seeks payment.
+The ancients said: "nature is impartial;
+Therefore it serves those who serve all."
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+Utopia
+
+Let your community be small, with only a few people;
+Keep tools in abundance, but do not depend upon them;
+Appreciate your life and be content with your home;
+Sail boats and ride horses, but don't go too far;
+Keep weapons and armour, but do not employ them;
+Let everyone read and write,
+Eat well and make beautiful things.
+Live peacefully and delight in your own society;
+Dwell within cock-crow of your neighbours,
+But maintain your independence from them.
+		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
+%
+The Sage
+
+Honest people use no rhetoric;
+Rhetoric is not honesty.
+Enlightened people are not cultured;
+Culture is not enlightenment.
+Content people are not wealthy;
+Wealth is not contentment.
+So the sage does not serve himself;
+The more he does for others, the more he is satisfied;
+The more he gives, the more he receives.
+Nature flourishes at the expense of no one;
+So the sage benefits all men and contends with none.
